Generate test Contract specifications for the milestone-map feature.
Mode: breakdown


## Discovery Strategy

Discover the feature's testing directory layout before starting:
```bash
ls docs/features/milestone-map/testing/                                 # journeys
ls docs/features/milestone-map/testing/<journey>/contracts/              # contracts
```

Invoke the `/gen-contracts` skill to generate Contract specifications from Journey documents and code reconnaissance.

### Eval Gate by Mode

- **Breakdown mode**: An eval-journey report must exist for all Journeys before proceeding. Check for `testing/<journey>/.eval-report.md` files. If any Journey lacks an eval report or scored below target, abort this task.
- **Quick mode**: The eval-journey gate is skipped. Proceed directly to Contract generation.

## SKIP_EVAL_GATE Directive

When this task runs in Quick mode as an automated pipeline task, SKIP_EVAL_GATE=true is in effect:

- **If SKIP_EVAL_GATE=true**: Skip the eval-journey prerequisite check. Do not require `testing/<journey>/.eval-report.md` files. Proceed directly to code reconnaissance and Contract generation.
- **If SKIP_EVAL_GATE is not set** (Breakdown mode): Require eval reports for all Journeys. Abort if any Journey scored below the eval target threshold.

## Process

Follow the `/gen-contracts` skill process flow:

1. **Resolve Language & Interfaces**: Detect project language and interface types from config
2. **Read Journeys**: Enumerate Journey directories under `docs/features/milestone-map/testing/` and read each `journey.md`
3. **Code Reconnaissance**: Build the Fact Table by reading source code per the reconnaissance rules
4. **Generate Contracts**: For each Journey, generate one Contract file per Step with six-dimension declarations (Preconditions, Input, Output, State, Side-effect, Invariants). Apply risk-driven Outcome density.
5. **Validate Contracts**: Schema validation for structural completeness. Retry once on failure.
6. **Write Output**: Write Contract files to `docs/features/milestone-map/testing/<journey>/contracts/` and Fact Table to `.forge/fact-table.json`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 1 Contract file generated per Journey
- [ ] Each Contract has six-dimension declarations with semantic descriptors (no regex)
- [ ] Risk-driven Outcome density targets met per Journey risk level
- [ ] Fact Table written to `.forge/fact-table.json`
- [ ] All Contracts passed schema validation
