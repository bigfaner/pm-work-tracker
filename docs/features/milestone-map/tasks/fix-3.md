# Fix: T-test-3 agent stalled during e2e execution

## Root Cause

Task-executor agent stalled (no progress for 600s) while running e2e tests for milestone-map feature. Likely stuck on test execution command. Need to retry e2e test run and record result.

## Reference Files

- Source: {{SOURCE_FILES}}
- Test script: {{TEST_SCRIPT}}
- Test results: {{TEST_RESULTS}}

## E2E Fix Boundaries

When fixing E2E test failures, observe these boundaries:

**Forbidden:**
- Starting dev server (`npx expo start`, `npm run dev`, etc.)
- Running `npm install` more than 3 times — mark task as blocked if dependency installation fails 3 times
- Running e2e tests (`just test-e2e`) — regression is verified by the dispatcher after fix completes
- Manually opening browser to verify rendering

**Correct workflow:**
1. Read failing test + corresponding component source
2. Compare test's expected testID/selectors vs actual DOM structure
3. Modify component (add testID) or test (adjust selectors/assertions)
4. `just test` — unit tests must pass
5. Record completion

## Verification

After fixing, verify the fix works:
1. `just test [scope]` — must pass

E2e regression is verified by the dispatcher, not by this fix task.

When this task is recorded as completed via `task record`, the source task T-test-3 is automatically restored to pending if all its dependencies are completed.
