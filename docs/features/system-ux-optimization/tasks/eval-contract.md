Evaluate Contract quality for the system-ux-optimization feature using the 6-dimension rubric (1000-point scale).

## Feature Paths

Discover the feature's testing directory layout before starting:
```bash
ls docs/features/system-ux-optimization/testing/                                 # journeys
ls docs/features/system-ux-optimization/testing/<journey>/contracts/              # contracts
```

## Discovery Strategy
Scan `tests/<journey>/_contracts/` for all Contract files per Journey.

For each Journey's Contracts:
1. Run `/eval --type contract` using the contract rubric (`eval/rubrics/contract.md`)
2. Scoring dimensions: Completeness, Semantic Purity, Precondition Exclusivity, Fact Alignment, Surface Fitness, Internal Consistency
3. Target score: 850/1000 with all dimensions above min thresholds

If any Contract fails evaluation after max iterations, report the failure and abort. Do not proceed to gen-test-scripts with low-quality Contracts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Contracts scored >= 850/1000
- [ ] All dimensions above min threshold per rubric
- [ ] Eval report written to `tests/<journey>/.eval-report.md`
